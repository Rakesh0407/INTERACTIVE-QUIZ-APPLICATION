This project focuses on building a fully functional Quiz Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose of the application is to present users with a series of multiple-choice questions, allow them to select answers, and provide instant feedback indicating whether their selection was correct or incorrect. The quiz dynamically loads questions from a predefined set stored in a JavaScript array, ensuring flexibility and ease of maintenance. After each response, the application highlights the correct answer, disables further selections, and displays a message indicating the result. It also keeps track of the user's score and presents the total at the end of the quiz. Users can then choose to restart the quiz and try again. The interface is designed to be clean, responsive, and user-friendly, making the experience intuitive on both desktop and mobile devices. This project demonstrates essential web development skills such as DOM manipulation, event handling, conditional logic, and dynamic rendering of content. It also introduces concepts of application state management in JavaScript, such as maintaining the current question index and calculating scores. Overall, this quiz app is a great exercise for beginners to practice building interactive web applications while reinforcing their understanding of front-end development fundamentals.
